[Terraform Registry](https://registry.terraform.io/) provides a method of installing providers and modules for use with Terraform.


Full documentation on installing `terraform` can be found on [the Terraform project website](https://www.terraform.io/).


You can create a proxy repository in Nexus Repository Manager (NXRM) that will cache packages from a remote Terraform registry, like
[Terraform Registry](https://registry.terraform.io/). Then, you can make the `terraform` client use your Nexus Repository Proxy 
instead of the remote repository.
 
To proxy a Terraform repository, you simply create a new 'terraform (proxy)' as documented in 
[Repository Management](https://help.sonatype.com/repomanager3/nexus-repository-administration/repository-management) in
detail. Minimal configuration steps are:

- Define 'Name' - e.g. `terraform-proxy`
- Define URL for 'Remote storage' - e.g. [https://registry.terraform.io/](https://registry.terraform.io/)
- Select a `Blob store` for `Storage`

Using the `terraform` client, you can now download packages from your NXRM Terraform proxy like so:

- Define a `network-mirror` in your Terraform config file as documented [here](https://www.terraform.io/cli/config/config-file#provider-installation)

  (**NOTE**: you must append `/v1/providers/` to the repository URL) e.g.
  ```
  # ~/.terraformrc
  provider_installation {
    network_mirror {
      url = "https://nexus.com/repository/terraform-proxy/v1/providers/"
    }
  }
  ```
    
The configuration above tells terraform to fetch (and install) packages from your NXRM Terraform proxy. The NXRM Terraform proxy will 
download any missing packages from the remote Terraform repository, and cache the packages on the NXRM Terraform proxy.
The next time any client requests the same package from your NXRM Terraform proxy, the already cached package will
be returned to the client.
